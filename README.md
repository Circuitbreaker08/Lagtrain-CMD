# Lagtrain-CMD

About a month ago I found out about the color command in cmd and had been recently been listening to this song a lot. I've seen the trend of making Bad Apple play on pretty much anything so I decided to switch things up a bit. I acknowledge that the colors are a bit off, it's an artifact from image compression and cmd font can go only so small.

I decided to publish source code for anyone interested so have fun!
